		<p>Results may vary.  Manufacturers are often known to break call
		recording functionality on their devices, and there isn\'t a whole lot I
		can do about it.</p>
		<p>Check local laws regarding recording of telephone conversations.
		Some localities may ban the recording of telephone conversations, or may
		require both parties to be informed of the recording first.  Also, if you
		are talking to someone in a different locality their recording laws may
